                <p className="Paragraph">
                  The input header allows the analyst to specify the data in which they would like to discover
                  narratives. A dataset must be selected. All other fields are optional filters: leave all of them
                  empty to generate an analysis of the entire dataset, or specify some to narrow down your search.
                </p>
                <div className="ImageContainer">
                  <img src={input} alt="Input" className="Image"/>
                </div>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  <b>1. Dataset filter</b>: This filter allows you to choose the dataset for which you would like to generate
                  a report, from all the datasets available.
                </p>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  <b>2. Keywords filter</b>: Leave the keywords field empty to see all tweets, regardless of their
                  content, or specify a keyword to only return those tweets that contain that keyword. For example,
                  searching for "Messi" will limit the results to those tweets that contain the word "Messi". The
                  search is not case-sensitive, so searching messi or Messi will return the same results, but it is
                  sensitive to spelling, including special characters, so searching Mbapp√© or Mbappe will return
                  different results. Some special characters may not be supported, for example, it is not possible to
                  search for exclamation marks.
                </p>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  You can also use more than one keyword. If you do so, you will need to
                  choose between "Any keyword" and "All keywords" to indicate how your keywords should be combined in
                  the search. Selecting the option "Any keyword" (under the keyword field) will return all tweets that
                  contain any of the keywords: that is, they contain at least one of the keywords but not necessarily
                  all of them. Selecting "All keywords", on the other hand, will only return tweets that contain all of
                  the keywords (although not necessarily in the same order as you enter them here). For example,
                  searching Messi Ronaldo and selecting "Any" will return tweets that contain either of the two words.
                  This allows you to compare how each of these two players is being mentioned. Selecting "All" will
                  only return tweets that contain both. This allows you to understand how they are mentioned together.
                </p>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  If "#" is used at the start of the keyword (e.g. "#myhashtag"), only tweets that contain this hashtag
                  will be returned. If "@" is used at the start of the
                  keyword (e.g. "@journalist"), only tweets by authors with that keyword in their Twitter user name or
                  user description will be returned. In other words, the latter essentially allows the analyst to
                  filter the data based on users.
                </p>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  If you would only like to return results where two or more words appear together, you can wrap them
                  in double inverted commas: for example, the query "Cristiano Ronaldo" will only return terms that
                  contain "Cristiano" and "Ronaldo" in that order, with nothing in between.
                </p>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  <b>3. Languages filter</b>: By default, the report will show results for all languages ("All"). If a
                  specific language is selected, however, only the tweets in that language will be shown. Note that
                  some languages contained in this list might not be present in the data. A tweet's language label was
                  identified automatically by Twitter (X) using AI. Each tweet is assumed to be in one language
                  primarily. Therefore a tweet may not be returned by this filter if only part of that tweet is in that
                  language
                </p>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  <b>4. Sentiment filter</b>: By default, the report will show results for all sentiments ("All"). If a
                  specific sentiment is selected however (i.e. "Positive", "Negative" or "Neutral"), only the tweets
                  with that sentiment will be shown. The sentiment of each tweet was identified automatically using AI.
                </p>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  <b>5. Country filter</b>: By default, the report will show results for all countries ("All"). The
                  "Author's country" is inferred from the location authors declare as part of their profile. The
                  "Tweet's country", on the other hand, corresponds to the location given when the author publishes a
                  particular tweet. Note that selecting the option "All" will also return results without a declared
                  location, which usually compose the majority of the data.
                </p>

                <p className="Paragraph">
                  <b>6. Dates filter</b>: Leave the date fields empty to get results for the entire time period covered
                  by the chosen dataset. You can also specify only a start date or only an end date. Clicking on the
                  "Last day", "Last week", "Last month" or "Last year" buttons will compute the date range automatically
                  based on the current date. The user can also select the date directly on the pop-up date picker after
                  clicking on the date field: the double arrow buttons (in red on Figure below) allow them to change
                  the year while the single arrow buttons (in blue) allow them to change the month. If entering a date
                  yourself instead of selecting it in the pop-up date picker, it must be in the "YYYY-MM-DD" format.

                  <b>7. "Show results" button</b>: Clicking the "Show results" button will generate the report for the selected
                  input filters. The report will be shown on the same page, below the input header. The report can take from a
                  few seconds to a few minutes to be generated, depending on the amount of data matching the filters.

                  button is clicked, a pop-up will appear asking the user to specify the name they would like to give
                  to this particular search and confirm (see Figure below). The report can then be loaded again from

                  community each user belongs to as inferred from their retweets in the overall dataset. Note that the
                  community a user is labelled by is fixed: this means that the user will be labelled as belonging to
                  the same community across queries, and community "1" for instance always refers to the same community.
                  Users are represented as dots in the visualisation. Hovering over a dot will display the user's
                  description (if available) as well as the community number. Clicking on a datapoint will open the
                  user's profile on Twitter (X) in a new tab.

                  click on the "Generate" button (see 1 on Figure) to create the visualisation. The "Nb communities" field (see
                  2) defines how many of the most active communities should be highlighted in the visualisation: e.g.
                  a value of 10 means the 10 most active community for the current search will be highlighted in the
                  visualisation. Visually, different communities are signified with different colors in the graph (see 3).
                  Users shown in grey are those that belong to communities that are not in the top N most active,
                  where N is the number of communities defined in the "Nb communities" field.
